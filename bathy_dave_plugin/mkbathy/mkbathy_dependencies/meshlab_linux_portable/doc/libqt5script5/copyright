     (i)   the header files of the Library have not been modified; and
     (ii)  the incorporated material is limited to numerical parameters, data
           structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and
           templates; and
     (iii) you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General
           Public License version 2.1.

 Moreover, you may apply this exception to a modified version of the Library,

 Library into the modified Library's header files unless such material is
 limited to (i) numerical parameters; (ii) data structure layouts;
