# Project `dave`

Dave is a simulation environment to support the rapid testing and evaluation of underwater robotic solutions, specifically underwater vehicles (AUVs/UUVs) operating autonomously and completing missions that involve autonomous maniputlation.  The environment is built upon existing ROS and Gazebo infrastructure, particularly the [UUV Simulator](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/) and WHOI's [ds_sim](https://bitbucket.org/whoidsl/ds_sim/src/master/).

## Quick Start

* For a high-level overview of the project, see the release highlight videos:
    * [Release 2.0.0 Highlight Video, September 2020](https://vimeo.com/462024036)
        * Narrated version of the [Electrical Mating](https://vimeo.com/463124725) demonstration.
    * [Release 1.0.0 Highlight Video, June 2020](https://vimeo.com/426414758).
* For an overview of what is included in the most recent release, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Lab/dave/blob/master/Changelog.md)
* To review the project plans and priorities for future development efforts consider submitting an issue or pull request.
* To try the simulation, follow the [Installation Tutorial](/dave/contents/installation/Installation).

## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to provide the following capabilities:

* Visual, physical and (hydro)dynamic models of generlized vehicle, manipulator and sensor elements.
* Simulation of sensing specific to underwater robotics including perception (e.g., sonar, underwater lidar and optical imaging) and navigation (e.g., DVL and USBL).
* Parameterized representations of the ocean environment including seafloor bathymetry and ocean currents.

These capabilities will enable support the development of autonomous systems capable of multi-phase underwater missions over large time and space scales.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the robotics community. We are particularly interested in contributions to extend and improve capabiliteis associated with the objectives described above. To contribute, please submit an issue or a [pull request](https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Lab/dave/pulls).

In addition to our officially supported, core features, Dave also includes a number of features that are supported exclusively by community members. Click here for the current list of [community supported features](Community-Supported-Features).

# Tutorials and Demonstrations

Step-by-step guides to illustrate working examples how to accomplish certain tasks and demonstrate features of the project.

## Project Setup

Dave depends upon ROS Noetic and Gazebo 11 - with community support for previous versions of ROS and Gazebo.  The project may be installed directly on your host or run using Docker.

* Check to make sure you meet the [System Requirements](contents/installation/System-Requirements).
* Follow the [Installation Tutorials](contents/Installation) to set up your system.
