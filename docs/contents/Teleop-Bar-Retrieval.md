After successful installation, users will launch an underwater environment containing a RexROV vehicle with a mounted Oberon 7 arm. A rectangular bar is located on the seafloor of the environment.
```
roslaunch dave_demo_launch dave_demo.launch
```

## Controlling the Vehicle

The vehicle can be teleoperated using a Gamepad.

You will need a joystick to perform the actual mission. The Logitech F310 Gamepad Mapping provides key mappings for maneuvering the vehicle and arm. See [this page](https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Lab/dave/wiki/Logitech-F310-Gamepad-Mapping).

## Demonstration Videos

Below are a few videos that demonstrate teleoperation of the vehicle and arm to successfully grasp the rectangular bar.
