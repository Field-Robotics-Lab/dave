```

```yaml
# Aux links for the upper right navigation
aux_links:
  "Just the Docs on GitHub":
    - "//github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs"

# Makes Aux links open in a new tab. Default is false
aux_links_new_tab: false
```

## Heading anchor links

```yaml
# Heading anchor links appear on hover over h1-h6 tags in page content
# allowing users to deep link to a particular heading on a page.
#
# Supports true (default) or false
heading_anchors: true
```

## Footer content

```yaml
# Footer content
# appears at the bottom of every page's main content
# Note: The footer_content option is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please use `_includes/footer_custom.html` for more robust
markup / liquid-based content.
footer_content: "Copyright &copy; 2017-2020 Patrick Marsceill. Distributed by an <a href=\"https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs/tree/master/LICENSE.txt\">MIT license.</a>"

# Footer last edited timestamp
last_edit_timestamp: true # show or hide edit time - page must have `last_modified_date` defined in the frontmatter
last_edit_time_format: "%b %e %Y at %I:%M %p" # uses ruby's time format: https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/time/rdoc/Time.html

# Footer "Edit this page on GitHub" link text
gh_edit_link: true # show or hide edit this page link
gh_edit_link_text: "Edit this page on GitHub."
gh_edit_repository: "https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs" # the github URL for your repo
gh_edit_branch: "master" # the branch that your docs is served from
# gh_edit_source: docs # the source that your files originate from
gh_edit_view_mode: "tree" # "tree" or "edit" if you want the user to jump into the editor immediately
```

_note: `footer_content` is deprecated, but still supported. For a better experience we have moved this into an include called `_includes/footer_custom.html` which will allow for robust markup / liquid-based content._

- the "page last modified" data will only display if a page has a key called `last_modified_date`, formatted in some readable date format
- `last_edit_time_format` uses Ruby's DateTime formatter; see examples and more information [at this link.](https://apidock.com/ruby/DateTime/strftime)
- `gh_edit_repository` is the URL of the project's GitHub repository
- `gh_edit_branch` is the branch that the docs site is served from; defaults to `master`
- `gh_edit_source` is the source directory that your project files are stored in (should be the same as [site.source](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/))
- `gh_edit_view_mode` is `"tree"` by default, which brings the user to the github page; switch to `"edit"` to bring the user directly into editing mode

## Color scheme

```yaml
# Color scheme supports "light" (default) and "dark"
color_scheme: dark
```
<button class="btn js-toggle-dark-mode">Preview dark color scheme</button>

<script>
const toggleDarkMode = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-dark-mode');

jtd.addEvent(toggleDarkMode, 'click', function(){
  if (jtd.getTheme() === 'dark') {
    jtd.setTheme('light');
    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Preview dark color scheme';
  } else {
    jtd.setTheme('dark');
    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Return to the light side';
  }
});
</script>

## Google Analytics

```yaml
# Google Analytics Tracking (optional)
# e.g, UA-1234567-89
ga_tracking: UA-5555555-55
ga_tracking_anonymize_ip: true # Use GDPR compliant Google Analytics settings (true by default)
```

## Document collections

By default, the navigation and search include normal [pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).
Instead, you can also use [Jekyll collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) which group documents semantically together.

For example, put all your documentation files in the `_docs` folder and create the `docs` collection:
```yaml
# Define Jekyll collections
collections:
  # Define a collection named "docs", its documents reside in the "_docs" directory
  docs:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true

just_the_docs:
  # Define which collections are used in just-the-docs
  collections:
    # Reference the "docs" collection
    docs:
      # Give the collection a name
      name: Documentation
      # Exclude the collection from the navigation
      # Supports true or false (default)
      nav_exclude: false
      # Exclude the collection from the search
      # Supports true or false (default)
      search_exclude: false
```

You can reference multiple collections.
This creates categories in the navigation with the configured names.
```yaml
collections:
  docs:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true
  tutorials:
    permalink: "/:collection/:path/"
    output: true

just_the_docs:
  collections:
    docs:
      name: Documentation
    tutorials:
      name: Tutorials
```
